# The Wilderness Almanac

**A sandbox campaign tool for creative GMs.**

Made for game masters planning a hexcrawl and solo players discovering a world as they go.

Create a thoughtfully generated, configurable wilderness with forests, mountains, rivers, settlements and adventure sites.

Reshape it for your campaign, track the party through fog of war, and keep notes, dice rolls and oracle answers in one place.

Works on desktop and mobile.

## Get started

Choose **New campaign**, preview and configure a world, then create your campaign.

You can then edit the map, move the party and record the adventure in the Party Journal.

Campaigns save in your browser. Export JSON for backups or another device.

Share-map links recreate the generated world without your edits or exploration.

See the [short user guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) for more.
